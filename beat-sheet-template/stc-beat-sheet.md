# Save The Cat Beat Sheet

Based on Blake Snyder's "Save The Cat" This template provides the foundations for the familiar three act story beat sheet.

## Title

Titles should be clever and somewhat ironic.

## Logline

Answers the single most important questions: What's the movie about?

A catchy and clear logline must express the tone of the story and it's potential

## Theme

Not the plot or charater description -- the underlying theme. The "primal" appeal to the audiance. This is best understood by identifying the genre.

### Genres

1. Monsters In The House: Alien, Panic Room, Jaws, Tremors, The exorcist, Fatal Attraction

2. Golden Fleece: Star Wars, Wizard of Oz, Back to the Future, Planes Trains and Automobiles, Heist Movies
